# React Essentials

Learn how to build fast, interactive UIs with React â€” the right way.

Youâ€™ll walk through:
- ðŸ§± JSX and reusable components
- ðŸ§  Props, state, and controlled inputs
- ðŸ”„ Effects, rendering flow, and event handling
- ðŸ§° Routing, lifting state, and using hooks effectively

This setup gives you:
- A preconfigured Vite + React + TypeScript project
- One route per concept â€” rendered by a real React component
- Space in each `src/pages/PageName.tsx` to learn-by-doing

No tutorial hell. Just real practice in a working app.
